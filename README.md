# VSCode_Apex
This is a Visual Studio Code extension which provides language support for the Salesforce Apex language. Apex is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language that allows developers to execute flow and transaction control statements on the Force.com platform server in conjunction with calls to the Force.com API.

Here are some useful VS Code editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Toggle preview (`Shift+CMD+V` on OSX or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux)
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+Space` (OSX) to see a list of Markdown snippets
